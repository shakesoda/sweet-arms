ARM Assembly scratch repo.

This code is likely bad, stupid and unintentionally dangerous in some way, but feel free to poke around.

Well-explained suggestions for better ways to solve absolutely anything here are welcome.

## Dependencies:
Requires only libc and SDL 1.2*
```
# for debian/ubuntu:
# apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev build-essential
```

## Compiling:
```
$ make
$ make tests
```

* note: it's 1.2 for convenience; 2.0 isn't available in the Ubuntu 12.04 repos
